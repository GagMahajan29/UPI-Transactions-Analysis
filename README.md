# UPI-Transactions-Analysis
The UPI Data Analysis dashboard immediately surfaces key metrics—total transactions, total transaction value, average value per transaction, and success rate—to give an at-a-glance view of platform performance. Below, a dual-axis line chart shows daily transaction counts and volumes over time, highlighting growth trends. A breakdown by payment channel (bank apps, third-party wallets, QR) uses a stacked bar chart. Finally, a table lists the total data which can again be filtered using the slicers present on the page.
